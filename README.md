This is my first repo, and I am currently doing research on AI and ML. One of the things I have researched is TensorFlow.

# TensorFlow
TensorFlow is a software library for deep learning and doing graph-based computations quickly. Libraries like this have working and optimized versions of algorithms, which are "math" and can be written with regular code. It is much faster than high-level languages, such as Python. It does this by utilizing the GPU to compute. Tt is also open source.

However, TensorFlow is not a high level library for neural networks, so it is needed to implement a neural net from scratch, but it is quicker if it is done in TensorFlow.
